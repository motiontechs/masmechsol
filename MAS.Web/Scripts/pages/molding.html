                <h2 class="page-headings">Plastic Manufacturing - Plastic Injection Molding</h2>
                <p>MAS Mechsol's core manufacturing competencies include thermoplastic molding, insert molding, two-shot molding, transfer tooling, and assembly.</p>
                <ul class="listing">
                    <li>Insert molding is often used to reduce the costs associated with adding inserts as a secondary operation. MAS Mechsol works with customers to source a high quality insert and offers both manual and automated insert molding options depending on customer requirements for timing and cost.</li>
                    <li>Two-shot molding is another way MAS Mechsol can reduce costs associated with multiple handling. MAS Mechsol can shoot two different resins in the same process to add additional features such as grip, color variation, added protection, sealing, and even chemical bonding.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Combining our various molding methods with fully automated, semi-automated, or manual assembly allows API to be a turn-key plastic manufacturer and a one-stop shop.</p>
                <h2 class="page-headings">Plastic Injection Mold Tooling Transfer Made Easy</h2>
                <p>MAS Mechsol engineers work with you to identify issues early in the mold transfer process, including mold quality and compatibility concerns, and will make recommendations for resolution.</p>
                <p>MAS Mechsol can assist in the facilitation of moving your plastic injection mold, qualify the mold for future production, and make mold repairs in our full service tool room if necessary.</p>
