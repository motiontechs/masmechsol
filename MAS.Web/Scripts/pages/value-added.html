                <p>MAS Mechsol's versatility is displayed by the vast array of resins that are used in manufacturing plastic components.</p>
                <ul class="listing">
                    <li>MAS Mechsol excels in working with difficult-to-process engineering resins including PEEK, Ryton, Lexan, Valox, and Polyarylsulfone</li>
                    <li>MAS Mechsol has many years of experience in manufacturing plastic components using high temperature and high performance plastic injection molding resins (PC, ABS, Acrylic, PVC, TPE, PI, PEI, PPS, PES)</li>
                    <li>Glass filled, composites, or nanoclay materials and added reinforcements, such as plasticizers, pigments, or modifiers, can help to add strength, durability, and increase product performance</li>
                    <li>Experienced in molding thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs) for rubber replacement applications to improve strength, processablility & colorability, cut & abrasion resistance, and load bearing capacity while simultaneously reducing cost</li>
                    <li>MAS Mechsol's chemical bonding capabilities (polyamide to polyethylene) and ability to fill resins comprised of up to 94% metal loaded alloys make us the molder of choice for many industries</li>
                    <li>Current markets: Security, Lighting, Military, Defense, Medical/Dental, Life Safety, Aerospace, Healthcare, Automotive, Fasteners, Displays, and more</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Selecting the proper material for a specific application can be challenging and overwhelming. MAS Mechsol has many years of knowledge and experience processing a vast array of resins and can assist in material selection.</p>
