                <p>MAS Mechsol' Design Engineering Group supports the design and build of custom small volume tools. From complete mechatronic systems to small mechanical adapters. MAS Mechsol' team of engineers and technicians adapt our expertise to specific customer requirements all with the aim of customer satisfaction. Our tool build group works with manufacturers and product developers at all phases of production.</p>
                <p>Because we have found that many customers tool needs require significant robustness, longevity and flexibility, MAS Mechsol employs significant effort and resources to make particularly sure that the mechanical design and architecture of a custom tool is reviewed multiple times by our internal engineering team and with our customers. Frequently these tools will remain in service for multiple decades and are modified to meet the changing needs of a customer's product or engineering team. MAS Mechsol engineers takes pride in our ability to provide ideas, inputs and solutions that are often outside of the box. We also strive to leverage our extensive functional test and electronic design capabilities to deliver complete and cost effective solutions.</p>
                <p>When it comes time to build the custom tool customers can rest assured that our tool builders have the experience and craftsmanship to deliver something that not only functions properly, but is clearly built with pride. Let MAS Mechsol translate your experiment into a reliable production tool.</p>
